To use this Terraform code to create a Google Cloud Storage bucket, you will need to do the following:

1.   Install Terraform on your local machine
2.    Create a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project and a service account with the necessary permissions to create and manage Cloud Storage buckets
3.    Set the environment variable GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS to the path of the JSON file containing your service account's key or paste the path to JSON File in the main.tf file..
4.    Run terraform init to initialize the provider and download the necessary plugins
5.    Run terraform plan to see what actions Terraform will take when you apply the code
6.    If the plan looks correct, run terraform apply to create the Cloud Storage bucket.

Note: You may need to configure the project and region variables in the main.tf file to match your GCP project and desired region. You can also customize the bucket's name and other properties by modifying the resource "google_storage_bucket" block in the terraform.tfvars file.
